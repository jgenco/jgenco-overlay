#RStudio has two problems when building with Electron on Prefix systems
#First it either needs either SUID or on a linux host w/ CONFIG_USER_NS=y set
#This should be overidable with --no-sandbox .
#Second, while loading .node files the .node file will seek out host libraries
#instead of the Prefix system libraries
#The .node files might need to be compiled with rpath(s) set - I don't know
#This could be tested with patchelf command - using even the Official binaries.
#Do Other Electron apps(vscode,discorse,slack) work in prefix enviroments?
